# Best Shop

This is the project I made after courses (NetNinja) of
- HTML
- CSS (basics, grid, flexbox)
- **SCSS**

To do this webpage I based on AdobeXd project from 
https://xd.adobe.com/view/31804ad0-5f57-46e0-6edf-a5f54c37078a-47b1/grid/?fbclid=IwAR1eS9j27IE32L_tokDn3FFTq0Ppl45ko8xVsdUhBsr7TJS3_kY6keKPX7E

- RWD with Mobile First approach
- BEM methodology

- VS Code

Extensions:
